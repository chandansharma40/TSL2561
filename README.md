# TSL2561
Ambient Light Sensor TSL2561 is a TWI based sensor. I made a cheap pyranometer by interfacing this sensor with Atmega. It works good in mild sunlight, however in bright daylight, I had to use some diffuser tiles and had to calibrate accordingly.

# Tested with
  1. Atmega 1284p
  2. Atmega 8L
  
# Libraries used
  1. UART_1.h - A UART library for USART1 of Atmgea 1284p
